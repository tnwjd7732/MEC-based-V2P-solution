# MEC-based-V2P-solution
Edge computing based V2P solution enhancing pedestrianâ€™s smartphone energy efficiency   
   
**NOTE (2021.03.07)**   
+ I am currently working on this experiment. **(Not finished code)**
+ Various ns3 basic files such as packet-sink.cc, udp-client.cc, point-to-point-helper.cc (including header files) were modified to suit my simulation. 
+ Therefore, execution without such files is impossible with only lte-mec.cc file.      
+ I am going to upload the rest of the code after all the simulation is over. 
+ Any comments, questions or communication about my simulation(or research) are welcome! :)
